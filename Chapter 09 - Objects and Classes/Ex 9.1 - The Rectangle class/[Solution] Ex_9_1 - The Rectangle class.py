# (The Rectangle class) Following the example of the Circle class in Section 9.2, 
# design a class named Rectangle to represent a rectangle. The class contains:
# Two data fields named width and height.
# A constructor that creates a rectangle with the specified width and height. 
# The default values are 1 and 2 for the width and height, respectively.

# A method named getArea() that returns the area of this rectangle.
# A method named getPerimeter() that returns the perimeter.

# Draw the UML diagram for the class, and then implement the class. 
# Write a test program that creates two Rectangle objectsâ€”one with width 4 and height 40 and the other with width 
# 3.5 and height 35.7. Display the width, height, area, and perimeter of each rectangle in this order.

class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, width = 1, height = 2):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def getArea(self):
        return self.width * self.height

    def getPerimeter(self):
        return 2 * (self.width + self.height)
